not prototype, but model
  prototype would be concurrent/destributed in the normal way
  model is single process, single thread, with global notion of time
    but possibly stochastic (or even antagonistic) scheduler

possible approach
  model
    TLA+
    see newcombe-slides.pdf

not model for verification, but for learning, understanding *intent*, examining obvious corner cases
  model to answer the question: what is original and interesting about
  the approach in the paper
